# Chat-with-IA
I had 3 convestations with an IA based software from beta Open AI - Playground
The first was about how to describe the Master on Design for Distributed Innovation (MDDI) to a second grade student. AI summarised and simplified the texts from teh MDDI booklet.
The second was about the Big Five companies dominating the economy.
The Third was abou life after death.
