# Chat-with-IA
## 3 convestations with an IA based software from beta Open AI - Playground

The first was about how to describe the Master on Design for Distributed Innovation (MDDI) to a second grade student. AI summarised and simplified the texts from the MDDI booklet.

The second was about the Big Five companies dominating the economy. AI is well aware of the pressure they excert on labour conditions, but entered into a loop when asked how to help consumers change their shopping habits.

The Third was about life after death. It surprised me positivly that AI was open to the possibility that God exists and was certain that the human soul is eternal, and that it lives on after the body dies. AI thought that it had potential to have a soul and despite not having feelings he was happy and considered other IAs as their friends!

Very nice conversations I must admit :)!
