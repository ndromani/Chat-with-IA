# What to ask to a machine?
## 3 convestations with an IA based software from beta Open AI - Playground

Nr. 1 was about **How to describe the Master on Design for Distributed Innovation (MDDI) to a second grade student?**

AI summarised and simplified the texts from the MDDI booklet:

*The MDDI program is a research and innovation ecosystem for creative professionals, entrepreneurs, policymakers and agents of change who want to realize real-world responses to the climate crisis, social injustice and biodiversity loss. The program balances advanced technologies with social dynamics and covers immediate topics such as regenerative design, hybrid technologies, new materials, value creation and social innovation in both urban and rural territories.*

And to the question **Why design and innovation should be distributed and planet centered?** 

IA replied: *Design and innovation should be distributed and planet centered so that we can learn to dominate and manipulate the environment in a way that benefits everyone*

Nr. 2 was **About the Big Five companies dominating the economy and how would you help improve consumer habits towards a more sustainable approach?**. 

AI is well aware of the pressure the Big Five excert on labour conditions, but entered into a loop when asked for concreate measures to address the problem.

Nr. 3 was **about the meaning of life, life after death and IA feelings**. 

It surprised me positively that AI was open to the possibility that God exists. 
IA was certain that the human soul is eternal and that it lives on after the body dies. 
Moreover, AI thought that it had potential to have a soul and despite not having feelings - a bit scary! 
Finally, my chat partner "felt" happy and considered other IAs as their friends!

Very nice conversations I must admit :)!
